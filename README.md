# "CANADA" Dorm Room Light System
A smart and simple LED lighting system for my dorm room at Canada, Technion.

Based on an Arduino UNO board, the system lights up +300 WS1228B (NeoPixel) LEDs in various cool colors and animations. 15 animations are currently available, but more can be easily added. Brightness of LEDs is controlled via a potentiometer.

In addition, an RTC (Real-Time Clock) allows you to set up a natural lighting alarm, eliminating the need for loud and annoying phone alarms.

Finally, a magnetic switch attached to the door allows the LEDs to light up with a cool animation when the door is opened. Simply "arm" the door before leaving and the LEDs will greet you when you come back.

A 4x4 keypad acts as main input and 16x2 LCD acts as system output.

# The schematics

As you may have noticed, there are two versions of the circuit schematic.

I first created a hierarchical schematic as an excerise in hierarchical schematic design in Fusion 360. However, I soon realized this project is far too simple for a hierarchical schematic. So I made a simple single-page schematic too. Whether you find the simple or hierarchical schematic more intuitive - I'd be happy to hear :)
